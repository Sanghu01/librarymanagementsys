Library Management System (LMS) - README

This project is a simple implementation of a Library Management System (LMS) in Java. It allows librarians to manage books, patrons, and borrowing transactions efficiently. Below are the details and instructions for using the system.

Implementation Details
Classes
Book Class:

Represents a book with fields for title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
Provides methods for accessing and modifying these fields.
Patron Class:

Represents a patron with fields for name, age, and id.
Provides methods for accessing and modifying these fields.
Library Class:

Manages books and patrons using ArrayLists.
Provides methods for adding/removing books and patrons, checking out and returning books, and other necessary operations.
Main Class:

Contains the main method to run the application.
Provides a menu-driven interface for interacting with the library system.
Features
Add Book: Add a new book to the library.
Remove Book: Remove a book from the library.
Add Patron: Add a new patron to the library.
Remove Patron: Remove a patron from the library.
Check Out Book: Mark a book as checked out by a patron.
Return Book: Mark a book as returned to the library.
Display All Books: Display all books currently in the library.
Display All Patrons: Display all patrons registered with the library.
Error Handling
The system includes error handling for scenarios such as trying to check out an unavailable book, removing a non-existent book, etc. Users are provided with appropriate error messages for such cases.

Bonus Features
Search for Books: Implement a feature to search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
Patrons' Checked-Out Books: Allow patrons to view the books they have checked out.
Save and Load Library Data: Implement serialization to save and load library data from a file.
Instructions for Use
Compile and Run:

Compile all the Java files in your IDE or through the command line.
Run the Main class.
Menu Navigation:

Use the menu options to perform various operations such as adding/removing books or patrons, checking out/returning books, and displaying library information.
Error Handling:

Pay attention to error messages displayed if an operation fails due to incorrect input or invalid state.
Bonus Features (Optional):

Explore additional features like searching for books, viewing checked-out books for patrons, and saving/loading library data.
Development Environment
You can use any Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for development.
Ensure you have JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.
Conclusion
This Library Management System provides a robust solution for managing library resources efficiently. Its simple interface and error handling mechanisms make it user-friendly and reliable. Feel free to extend the functionality further as per your requirements or preferences.
